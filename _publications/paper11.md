We present large-eddy simulations (LES) of wind and wave-driven turbulent boundary layers in shallow water 
with Langmuir circulation using a variational multi-scale formulation of the Craik-Leibovich equa- tions. 
The simulations are performed using Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) based on quadratic non-uniform rational 
basis spline (NURBS) basis functions. Wind and wave-driven turbulent boundary layers over a flat bottom 
surface representative of open ocean conditions in inner-shelf regions with turbulent Langmuir number 
Lat = 0.7 and wind stress friction Reynolds number ReÏ„ = 395 are first simulated. The present results 
agree well with the reference results based on a spectral LES with higher mesh resolution. Then, 
to investigate the effect of seabed topography on the turbulence, we simulate turbulent boundary layers 
over a sloped bottom surface with wind and wave forcing parallel to the shore, representative of a 
surf-shelf transition zone. We find that the Langmuir cell size increases as the water column shallows 
approaching onshore and the cell center shifts to the onshore direction. The mean velocity and turbulent 
kinetic energy along the shore are quantified.
