Aeroelastic effects, which affect the dynamic responses of low-rise roof structures to extreme wind conditions, are often
neglected or oversimplified in current wind engineering design standards and applications. However, it is crucial to understand
the details of those aeroelastic effects for performance-based wind engineering. This paper presents an isogeometric
fluid–structure interaction (FSI) tool to investigate the aeroelastic effects of wind pressure distributions on roof structures
under different turbulent wind conditions. A representative low-rise roof structure is simulated with an FSI model using an
Arbitrary Lagrange-Eulerian-based variational multi-scale formulation coupled with isogeometricKirchhoff-Love shells. The
simulation results are compared to the quasi-steady approach and wind load provisions from ASCE 7-22. It shows that the
quasi-steady approach and the design standard underestimate the pressure fluctuations, indicating the necessity of using FSI
simulations to capture the aeroelastic effect for the roof of low-rise structures. This paper also studies the impacts of different
roof configurations, e.g., the number of roof panels and inflow turbulent intensity, on the distribution of pressure coefficients
and roof deflections. For the given mean wind speed, the mean pressure coefficient remains almost the same regardless of
the turbulent intensity and roof configuration. However, the pressure fluctuation (standard deviation) varies significantly with
the turbulence intensity and roof configuration. The aeroelastic effect also leads to complicated roof deflections at the crucial
location having the maximum pressure coefficient. The paper first describes the mathematical details of the FSI model
and simulation setup. Then, the pressure coefficients by the FSI simulation and design code are compared. Finally, the roof
deflection with different inlet turbulence intensities and roof configurations are presented and discussed.
