High fidelity thermal multi-phase flow simulations are in much demand to reveal the multi-scale and multi-physics
phenomena in metal additive manufacturing (AM) processes, yet accurate and robust predictions remain challenging. In this
paper, we present a novel computational framework by mixing interface-capturing/interface-tracking methods for simulating
the thermal multi-phase flows in metal AM applications, focusing on better handling the gas-metal interface, where AM
physics, such as phase transitions and laser-material interactions, mainly takes place. The framework, built on level set method
and variational multi-scale formulation (VMS), features three major contributions: (1) a simple computational geometry-based
re-initialization approach, which maintains excellent signed distance property on unstructured meshes, re-constructs an explicit
representation of gas-metal interface from the level set, and facilitates the treatment of the multiple laser reflections during
keyhole evolution in AM processes; (2) a fully coupled VMS formulation for thermal multi-phase governing equations, including
Navier-Stokes, level set convection, and thermodynamics with melting, solidification, evaporation, and interfacial force models;
and (3) a three-level recursive preconditioning technique to enhance the robustness of linear solvers. We first compare the
geometry-based re-initialization with the Eikonal partial differential equation (PDE)-based approach on two benchmark problems
on level set convection and bubble dynamics. The comparison shows the geometry-based approach attains equivalent and even
better performance on key criteria than the PDE-based counterpart. We then apply the developed framework to simulate two
AM experiments, which Argonne National Laboratory has recently conducted using in-situ high-speed, high-energy x-ray
imaging. The proposed frameworkâ€™s accuracy is assessed by thoroughly comparing the simulated results against experimental
measurements on various quantities. We also report important quantities that experiments cannot measure to show the modeling
capability.
