Thermal multi-phase flow analysis has been proven to be an indispensable tool in metal additive manufacturing (AM)
modeling, yet accurate and efficient simulations of metal AM processes remains challenging. This paper presents a flexible
and effective thermal multi-phase flow model for directed energy deposition (DED) processes. Departing from the data-fitted
or presumed deposit shapes in the literature, we first derive a deposit geometry model based on an energy minimization
problem with a mass conservation constraint. Then, an interface-capturing approach based on a signed distance function that
moves with the laser is constructed to represent the air–metal interface evolution. The approach can be applied to any type
of mesh without requiring the activation process of solid elements in a mesh. The coupled multi-phase Navier–Stokes and
energy conservation equations are solved by a variational multi-scale formulation (VMS). A density-scaled continuous surface
force (CSF) model is employed to incorporate the Marangoni effect, no penetration boundary condition, and the heat source
on the air–metal interface. We utilize the proposed method to simulate two representative metal manufacturing problems. The
simulated results are carefully compared with available experimental measurements and computational results from others. The
results demonstrate the accuracy and modeling capabilities of the proposed method for metal AM problems.
