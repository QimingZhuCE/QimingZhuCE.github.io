About me
======
I graduated from the Department of Civil Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. My research focuses on Metal/Concrete 3D Printing process modeling, Fluid-Structure Interactions, and Physics-Informed Neural Networks. I have published over 10 papers in top journals, including *Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering*, *Computational Mechanics*, and the *International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering*. My computational framework for metal additive manufacturing process modeling secured second place in two categories at the [AM Bench 2022](https://www.nist.gov/ambench/am-bench-2022-challenge-submissions-and-awards) competition organized by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Additionally, the corresponding paper was a finalist for the 33rd Robert J. Melosh Medal at Duke University. You can find my personal webpage [here](http://homepage.hit.edu.cn/zhuqiming).
