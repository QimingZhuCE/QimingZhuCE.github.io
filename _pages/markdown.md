## Mixed interface-capturing/interface-tracing formulation
<br/><img src='/images/Metal_AM_modeling_framework.png'>

* We developed a mixed interface-capturing/interface-tracing formulation for metal additive manufacturing modeling. The interface-capturing component is responsible for handling complex topological changes, such as the merging and separation of interfaces. The interface-tracking component constructs an explicit gas-metal interface, enabling the use of an explicit ray tracing-based laser model.
